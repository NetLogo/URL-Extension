# NetLogo URL extension

This is a NetLogo extension for working with URLs.

## Using

[Download](https://github.com/NetLogo/URL-Extension/downloads) and unzip to the extensions folder inside your NetLogo program folder.

The 5.0beta4 download will probably work with 5.0. If not, let us know.

For more information about NetLogo extensions in general, see the NetLogo User Manual.

## Building

Use the NETLOGO environment variable to tell the Makefile which NetLogo.jar to compile against.  For example:

    NETLOGO=/Applications/NetLogo\\\ 5.0 make

If compilation succeeds, `url.jar` will be created.

## Credits

The URL extension was written by Forrest Stonedahl.
